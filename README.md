# WeatherForecastProject.
I have made the use of HTML, CSS and JavaScript in this project. CSS has been used for the styling which includes background, margins, height to make  the project  impressive . JavaScript has been used for providing the actions and HTML has  been used  for displaying the web page to the user .
